# 📊 Dashboard

###  Overview  
A dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) that presents data in a structured, intuitive format, enabling users to monitor, analyze, and act on key insights in real time. Dashboards are widely used across industries—business, finance, healthcare, manufacturing to track performance metrics, visualize trends, and support data-driven decision-making. In the context of inflation analysis, dashboards serve as a central hub for exploring economic indicators across countries and regions.
