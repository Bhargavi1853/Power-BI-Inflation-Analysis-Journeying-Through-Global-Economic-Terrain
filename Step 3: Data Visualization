# 📊 Data Visualization

###  Overview  
Data visualization is the art and science of representing data graphically to make complex datasets more accessible, intuitive, and actionable. By leveraging charts, graphs, maps, and interactive visuals, analysts can uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that may be hidden in raw data. In this inflation analysis project, Power BI serves as the visualization engine to transform economic indicators into meaningful insights for decision-makers.
